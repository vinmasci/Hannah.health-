- No personalization or guidance

### New AI-Driven 4-Step Workflow
1. **Step 1: AI Conversational Assessment** (Left column)
2. **Step 2: Display Calculations** (Right column)
3. **Step 3: AI Meal Suggestions** (To be shown after assessment)
4. **Step 4: Auto-populate Kanban Board**

## ‚úÖ Completed Features

### 1. AI Conversational Assessment (Step 1)
- **Real AI Integration**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini for intelligent conversation
- **Natural Language Processing**: Understands variations, typos, and context
- **Dynamic Flow**: AI adapts questions based on user responses
- **Health Condition Handling**: 
  - Recognizes conditions even if misspelled (NAFLD ‚Üí Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease)
  - Asks appropriate follow-ups about severity
  - Respects privacy with "rather not say" options

#### Current Question Flow:
1. Health conditions (with intelligent follow-up if needed)
2. Age (accepts exact age or ranges like "mid 30s")
3. Biological gender
4. Height (parses "5'8", "173cm", etc.)
5. Weight (with "rather not say" option)
6. Daily steps (for base activity level)
7. Exercise details (asks for duration/intensity)
8. Main health goal
9. Dietary preferences

### 2. Smart Conversation Features
- **Question Numbering**: "Question 3 of 9" for progress tracking
- **No Excessive Thanks**: Brief acknowledgments instead of repetitive thanking
- **Intelligent Follow-ups**: 
  - Offers choices and waits for response
  - Doesn't persist when user says "no" or "that's it"
  - Asks for exercise intensity/duration for accurate TDEE
- **Context Awareness**: AI remembers previous answers in conversation

### 3. Display Column (Step 2)
- **Styling**: Matches Step 1 with purple gradient header
- **Position**: Now on the right side (was left)
- **Non-judgmental**: BMI shows just the number, no "overweight" labels
- **Live Updates**: Shows calculations as user provides data
- **Displays**:
  - BMI (without classifications)
  - TDEE (Total Daily Energy Expenditure)
  - Target Calories (based on goal)
  - Macro breakdown (protein, carbs, fat)
  - Profile summary

### 4. Advanced Calculations
- **Activity Multiplier**: Combines daily steps + exercise frequency
- **TDEE Calculation**: Uses Mifflin-St Jeor equation with smart multipliers
- **Goal-based Adjustments**:
  - Weight loss: -500 kcal/day
  - Muscle gain: +300 kcal/day
  - Maintenance: TDEE
- **Macro Distribution**: Adjusts based on goals (higher protein for weight loss, etc.)

### 5. Backend AI Enhancements
- **Session Management**: Maintains conversation context
- **Smart Goal Parsing**: 
  - Understands "lose weight, get rid of NAFLD" as weight loss goal
  - Recognizes multiple goals in one response
- **Structured Data Return**: Parses responses into usable data
