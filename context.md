- **AI-Powered Onboarding**: Conversational flow to understand user needs and generate personalized meal plans
- **Drag-and-Drop Meal Planning**: Visual Kanban-style board for intuitive meal organization
- **Smart Recipe Search**: Natural language AI-powered recipe discovery
- **Barcode Scanning**: Quick food entry via barcode recognition
- **Favorites Management**: Save and reuse favorite meals
- **Shopping List Generation**: Automated shopping lists from meal plans
- **WhatsApp Integration**: Natural language food logging via WhatsApp messaging
- **Multi-Platform Sync**: Seamless data sync between WhatsApp, web app, and AI chat
