2. What are you working on today?
3. Any blockers or dependencies?
4. How does this connect to Week 1 goals?

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- Domain registration delays → Have backup domains ready
- Development environment issues → Document setup procedures
- Authentication complexity → Start with basic email/password

### Medium Risk Items
- Component library scope creep → Focus on core components only
- Testing setup complexity → Use standard configurations initially
- Deployment pipeline issues → Have local development fallback

## Week 1 Deliverables Summary
1. **hannah.health domain** - Registered and configured
2. **GitHub repository** - Initialized with documentation
3. **React application** - Basic dual-mode architecture
4. **Component library** - Foundation with 5-10 core components
5. **Authentication system** - Basic email/password signup/login
6. **Deployment pipeline** - Vercel with preview environments
7. **Documentation** - Updated branding and developer guides
8. **Week 2 plan** - Detailed roadmap and task breakdown

This aggressive but achievable Week 1 plan establishes the critical foundation for Hannah.health while maintaining focus on the unique dual-mode requirements and medical-grade security standards.
