Meal planning that supports your health journey, not a quick fix

"What brought you here today?"

[Three beautiful cards to select from:]

Card 1: "I'm managing a medical condition"
üè• Soft blue gradient, medical icon

Card 2: "I want to improve my relationship with food"

### Our Story Section (Below the Fold)

#### Two-Column Layout: "Him" | "Her"

**[HIS STORY]**
> "I was the fitness guy - endurance cycling, always active. Then Hannah became pregnant, life got beautifully busy, and I stopped paying attention. In just 9 months, my liver inflammation markers tripled. Only 8kg heavier, but suddenly diagnosed with NAFLD.
>
> The shock was my wake-up call. I didn't want a fad diet - I wanted to change how I approached food for life. I built this app to be the companion I needed."

**[HER STORY]**
> "My relationship with food has been complicated. It's still a daily choice, and it's never perfect, but with the right support it gets a little easier every day.
>
> This isn't a magic solution - I have a team: doctors, nutritionist, therapist. But having a meal planning tool that doesn't trigger me, that focuses on nourishment over numbers? That's one less battle to fight."

### Trust Statement
> "Hannah isn't a replacement for medical care. It's a tool designed to support the guidance from your healthcare team."
