# Hannah Health iOS App Development Diary

## Session 22: Weekly View Implementation & Active Energy Investigation
*Date: September 3, 2025*

### Main Goals
1. ✅ Investigate Active Energy double-counting with steps
2. ✅ Add prompt for users with steps but no Active Energy
3. ✅ Implement weekly view with same ring visualization as daily
4. ✅ Fix weekly view to show exact same components as daily view

### Key Discoveries & Decisions

#### Active Energy Analysis
- **Finding**: iPhone Active Energy without Apple Watch is unreliable
- **Decision**: Keep both steps + Active Energy in TDEE calculation
- **Rationale**: 
  - Active Energy compensates for work intensity, stress, fidgeting not in BMR
  - Many users show 0 Active Energy despite high step counts
  - Added prompt to help users enable Active Energy in Settings

#### TDEE Calculation Validation
- Current formula: BMR + Steps + Active Energy + TEF (10% of food)
- Step calories: weight(kg) × 0.00045 per step (scientifically grounded)
- Progressive multipliers would only change ~12 calories (negligible)
- **Conclusion**: Current approach is best practice

### Weekly View Implementation

#### Phase 1: Historical Data Loading
- Created `loadHistoricalData()` to fetch 7 days from HealthKit & Supabase
- Fixed `DayData` structure mismatch (immutable properties issue)
- Successfully aggregates steps, calories, exercise for each day

#### Phase 2: Weekly Ring Visualization
- Initially tried shared `CombinedDonutChart` component
- **User requirement**: "EXACTLY like the daily ring"
- Moved `TDEEDonutRing` and `FoodProgressRing` to shared components
- Weekly view now uses identical components with weekly totals

#### Phase 3: Smart Weekly Aggregation
- Current week: Only shows data for days that have passed
- Past weeks: Shows full 7 days
- BMR, target, deficit scale with actual days of data
- Center shows avg/day when no segment selected (user requested)

### Technical Improvements

#### Files Created/Modified
- `DonutChartComponents.swift` - Shared ring components
- `WeeklyCaloriesView.swift` - Weekly aggregation view
- `DashboardViewModel.swift` - Added historical data loading
- Fixed duplicate `else` block causing class structure break

#### Color Consistency
- Sky blue for BMR
- Emerald for steps  
- Coral for exercise
- Teal for digestion (TEF)
- Pink/Yellow/Purple/Orange for meals

### Bug Fixes
1. Fixed `updateCurrentPeriodData()` using stale `selectedPeriod` value
2. Resolved `DayData` immutable properties by creating new instances
3. Fixed syntax error from duplicate else block breaking entire class
4. Corrected function vs value usage in WeeklyCaloriesView

### User Feedback
- "looking really good"
- "can we have it default to the ave/day metric when we click off the donut?"
- "it looks really amazing"
- Weekly view working exactly as requested

### Next Steps
- [ ] Test TDEE accuracy with real-world scenarios
- [ ] Consider adding monthly view with same ring pattern
- [ ] Potentially add export functionality for weekly data

*Session 22 Duration: ~3 hours*
*Major Achievement: Weekly view with identical ring visualization*
*User Satisfaction: "it looks really amazing"*
*Status: Weekly view fully functional with smart aggregation*

## Session 21: Enhanced Interactive Donut Chart
*Date: September 2, 2025*

### Main Goals
1. ✅ Make donut chart segments interactive/clickable
2. ✅ Show detailed information when segments are tapped
3. ✅ Improve visual representation of deficit
4. ✅ Add meal breakdown to food ring

### Implementation Journey

#### Initial State
- Static donut chart showing TDEE components
- All information always visible (cluttered)
- Deficit segment too small/incorrect
- No meal timing information

#### Evolution Process

1. **Made segments clickable**:
   - Each TDEE component (BMR, Steps, Exercise, TEF) now tappable
   - Added selection state tracking
   - Visual feedback: selected segments scale up slightly

2. **Dynamic center display**:
   - Default: Shows remaining/over calories
   - When segment selected: Shows that component's details
   - Clean transition animations

3. **Interactive info bar**:
   - Info bar appears below with context when selected
   - Tap background to deselect

4. **Enhanced Food Ring**:
   - Inner ring now shows meals by type with distinct colors:
     - Breakfast: Amber 400 (golden)
     - Morning/Afternoon/Evening Snacks: Orange 400
     - Lunch: Teal 400 (cyan)
     - Dinner: Purple 400
   - Added red deficit segment showing calories "saved" for weight loss
   - Deficit segment is interactive like other segments
   - Visual target: eat until colors reach red zone

#### Technical Details

**Files Modified**:
- `CaloriesView.swift` - Complete restructure with new components
- `DailySummaryCard.swift` - Reduced padding and frame sizes

**Key Components Added**:
- `SelectedSegmentDetail` - Shows info in center when segment tapped
- `SegmentInfoBar` - Contextual info bar below chart
- Enhanced `FoodProgressRing` with meal breakdown
- Interactive deficit segment with proper sizing

**Bug Fixes**:
- Fixed missing closing brace syntax error
- Corrected step calorie formula (weight * 0.00045)
- Fixed deficit segment sizing (now correct percentage of TDEE)
- Removed leftover helper structs causing compilation errors

#### User Experience Improvements
- **Tap to explore**: Information on demand instead of always visible
- **Visual clarity**: See meal timing and deficit at a glance
- **Accurate representation**: Deficit shown as actual percentage of TDEE
- **Consistent font sizes**: 28pt for all numbers in center
- **Clean info bar**: Square edges, minimal styling

### Lessons Learned
1. **Read error messages carefully** - "Expected '}'" means add a closing brace, don't overcomplicate
2. **Less is more** - Removing text clutter improved usability
3. **Interactivity > Static display** - Let users explore data when they want
4. **Visual accuracy matters** - Deficit must be proportional to actual calories
