# Files to Add to Xcode Project

## Instructions:
1. Open your HannahHealth.xcodeproj in Xcode
2. Right-click on the "MealPlan" folder in the project navigator
3. Select "Add Files to HannahHealth..."
4. Navigate to each of these new folders/files and add them:

## New Files Created:

### In `/Features/MealPlan/Models/`:
- ✅ MealPlanTypes.swift

### In `/Features/MealPlan/Services/`:
- ✅ FoodSearchService.swift

### In `/Features/MealPlan/Helpers/`:
- ✅ MealPlanHelpers.swift

### In `/Features/MealPlan/Components/`:
- ✅ TimePickerSheet.swift
- ✅ MealSlotCard.swift
- ✅ DayCard.swift
- ✅ MealPlanHeader.swift

## Make sure to:
1. Check "Copy items if needed" (should be unchecked since files are already in place)
2. Check "Add to targets: HannahHealth"
3. Click "Add"

## After adding files:
1. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. Build project (Cmd+B)

The errors should resolve once all files are properly added to the Xcode project.
