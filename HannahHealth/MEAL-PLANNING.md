   - Food name and description
   - Calorie count and macros (P/C/F)
   - Completion checkbox
   - Optional notes
4. **Weekly Goals Card**: Target calories, protein, carbs, fat, and deficit

### Data Structure

```swift
struct MealPlan {
    let id: String
    let userId: String
    let weekStartDate: Date
    let planData: MealPlanData
    let isActive: Bool
}

struct DayMealSlot {
    let id = UUID()
    var slotType: MealSlotType
    var time: String
    var meals: [Meal]  // Array of meals for multiple items
    var totalCalories: Int { meals.reduce(0) { $0 + $1.calories } }
}

struct Meal {
    var name: String
    let calories: Int
    let protein: Int?     // Grams of protein
    let carbs: Int?       // Grams of carbohydrates
    let fat: Int?         // Grams of fat
    let confidence: Double?  // Confidence rating 0-100%
    let id = UUID()
}

struct PlannedMeal {
    let mealType: String // breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack
    let name: String
    let calories: Int
    let protein: Double?
    let carbs: Double?
    let fat: Double?
    let time: String? // "8:00 AM"
    let notes: String?
    let isCompleted: Bool
}
```

### Multiple Items Per Meal

#### How It Works
Each meal slot can now contain multiple food items, allowing for realistic meal tracking:
- **Breakfast Example**: Omelette (234 cal) + Greek yogurt (150 cal) + Toast (180 cal) = 564 total calories
- **Individual Management**: Each item has its own calories, confidence rating, and can be edited/removed independently
- **Easy Addition**: Plus button adds new items to any meal slot
- **Smart Totaling**: Automatically calculates total calories and macros for all items in a meal

#### Smart Food Parsing
- **Comma/And Splitting**: Enter "eggs, toast and yogurt" â†’ automatically creates 3 separate items
- **Intelligent Recognition**: Handles various separators and trims whitespace
- **Individual Lookups**: Each item gets its own AI-powered nutrition search
- **Works Everywhere**: Both inline editing and chat commands support multi-item parsing

#### Complete Macro Tracking
- **Per Item**: Each food shows calories + optional protein, carbs, fat
- **Per Meal**: Total section shows combined calories and macros
- **Per Day**: Daily total with comprehensive macro breakdown
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Dividers and color coding for easy scanning

#### User Interface
- Each food item displays on its own line with:
  - Editable name (tap to edit inline)
  - Calorie count
  - Confidence indicator (color-coded)
  - Remove button (minus icon)
- "Add item" button at bottom of each meal slot
- **Total Section** (always shown):
  - Total calories for the meal
  - Macro breakdown (P/C/F) when available
  - Visual divider for clarity
- **Daily Totals**:
  - Prominent green calorie total
  - Detailed protein, carbs, fat breakdown
  - Clean card design at bottom of each day
- Auto-focus on new items for immediate typing

### Chat Integration

#### Natural Language Commands
Users can update meal plans through conversational chat:

**Adding Meals**:
- "Add chicken salad to Monday lunch" - Updates specific slot
- "Set all breakfasts to 3 egg omelette" - Updates all breakfast slots
- "Make Tuesday dinner salmon with veggies" - Replaces meal

**Bulk Operations**:
- "Add oatmeal to all breakfasts" - Updates entire week
- "Make all lunches vegetarian" - Applies to all lunch slots
- "Clear all snacks" - Removes all snack entries

**Smart Features**:
- Auto-searches nutrition data via Brave Search
- Shows confidence ratings (85% confident, 90% confident, etc.)
- Cleans user input ("Can you add..." â†’ just the food name)
- Handles common patterns ("3 egg" â†’ "3 egg omelette")

#### Confidence Ratings
Each food item shows data accuracy:
- ðŸŸ¢ **Green (90-100%)**: Official sources (McDonald's, USDA)
- ðŸŸ¡ **Yellow (70-90%)**: Common foods, verified databases
- ðŸŸ  **Orange (50-70%)**: Homemade, estimated values
- ðŸ”´ **Red (<50%)**: Low confidence, needs verification

The chat detects meal plan keywords and triggers appropriate actions.
