# Hannah Health Development Diary

## Session 1: Initial Setup & Chat Implementation
- Created basic chat interface with `WorkingChatView.swift`
- Set up OpenAI and Brave Search services
- Implemented natural language food logging

## Session 2: Fixing AI Integration (Current)

### Problem 1: "Can't use the internet"
**Issue**: ChatGPT wasn't using Brave Search results even though search was working
**Solution**: 
- Fixed OpenAI API response decoding (content changed from array to string)
- Enhanced system prompt to explicitly acknowledge web search results
- Added debug logging to track search execution

### Problem 2: Random Confidence Scores
**Issue**: Confidence scores seemed arbitrary (60-90%) without clear logic
**User Feedback**: "we should never use hardcoded values, they should always be from the search or database or chat gpts general knowledge"
**Solution**:
- Removed ALL hardcoded nutrition estimates (Big Mac = 563 cal, etc.)
- Now parses actual calories from Hannah's response using regex
- Confidence based on real data source quality:
  - 90%+ for official restaurant sites
  - 70-89% for nutrition databases
  - <70% for AI estimates

### Problem 3: Data Persistence
**Discussion**: Evaluated options (Core Data, CloudKit, UserDefaults, Supabase, Firebase)
**Decision**: Chose Supabase because:
- Cross-platform support (Android planned)
- Built-in authentication
- Real-time capabilities
- Row Level Security

**Implementation**:
1. Created `SupabaseService.swift` with auth and data methods
2. Generated complete database schema (`hannah_health_schema.sql`)
3. Set up 6 core tables with RLS policies
4. Updated `ChatViewModel` to save food entries
5. Created comprehensive `SUPABASE-SETUP.md` documentation

### Key Learnings
- OpenAI API can change response formats - need defensive coding
- Users expect real data, not estimates - always use actual sources
- Cross-platform requirements should be considered early
- Documentation is crucial for database setup

## Current State
- ✅ Chat working with real nutrition data
- ✅ Confidence scores from actual sources
- ✅ Supabase backend fully configured
- ⚠️ Auth UI not implemented (data won't save until users can log in)

## Session 3: Meal Planning & Shopping List

### Meal Plan Feature
**Implementation**: Created full meal planning system with Week 1 Magic concept
**UI Design**:
- Applied chat-style clean UI with glass morphism
- Dynamic time-based backgrounds matching dashboard
- Color-coded meal types (Breakfast: Sky, Lunch: Amber, Dinner: Indigo, Snack: Emerald)
- Day selector tabs with solid emerald for selected day
- Weekly goals summary card

**Chat Integration**: 
- Detects meal plan requests in natural language
- Generates personalized plans via ChatGPT
- Navigates to meal plan tab after generation

### Shopping List Feature
**Implementation**: Auto-generates from meal plan ingredients
**Features**:
- Smart consolidation of duplicate items
- Category organization (Produce, Proteins, Dairy, etc.)
- Progress ring showing completion percentage
- Category filter pills for quick filtering
- Check-off system with animations
- Add custom items capability

**Visual Consistency**:
- Same DynamicTimeBackground() as rest of app
- Theme.glassMorphism for all cards
- White text with opacity hierarchy
- Consistent color scheme across categories

### Key Design Decisions
- Used transparent black (50% opacity) instead of white backgrounds
- Kept dynamic backgrounds that change with time of day
- Made selected states solid colors for clarity
- Applied consistent glass morphism throughout

## Next Priority
Add authentication screens so data persistence activates. Backend is 100% ready.

## Code Quality Notes
- No hardcoded values per user requirement
- All nutrition data from web search or AI knowledge
- Proper error handling and debug logging
- Clean separation of concerns with service protocols
- Consistent UI patterns across all features

## Session 4: Security Audit

### Security Assessment Conducted
**Purpose**: Pre-GitHub push security check
**Findings**: Multiple CRITICAL vulnerabilities identified

### Critical Issues Found
1. **Hardcoded API Keys** in APIConfig.swift:
   - OpenAI production key exposed
   - Brave Search API key visible
   - Supabase credentials in plain text
   
2. **No Secure Storage**:
   - Keys stored in source code
   - No Keychain implementation
   - Tokens only in memory

3. **Missing Security Features**:
   - No certificate pinning
   - No input validation
   - Excessive debug logging
   - Weak session management

### Security Score: 2/10 - DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB

### Immediate Actions Required
- Remove all API keys from source code
- Add APIConfig.swift to .gitignore
- Implement environment-based configuration
- Remove sensitive data from logs
- Rotate all exposed keys after fixes

### Documentation Created
- **SECURITY-AUDIT.md**: Comprehensive security assessment
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Complete app architecture documentation
- Both referenced in context.md

### Next Steps Before GitHub Push
1. Emergency key rotation
2. Secure configuration implementation
3. Keychain storage setup
4. Debug logging removal

### Security Fixes Applied
1. **Created .gitignore** with comprehensive security rules
   - Blocks APIConfig.swift from commits
   - Excludes all key files and environment configs
   
2. **Created APIConfig.template.swift**
   - Safe template with placeholders
   - Can be committed to GitHub
   - Includes setup instructions
   - Has validation to check for misconfiguration
   
3. **Added Configuration README**
   - Step-by-step setup guide
   - Security best practices
   - Production recommendations
   - Troubleshooting help

**Status**: ⚠️ PARTIALLY RESOLVED - Template created, but actual keys still need to be moved to secure storage before pushing
