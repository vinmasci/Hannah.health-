## Session 25 - Critical Development Issues with Claude Code
**Date**: September 3, 2025  
**Time**: Afternoon
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Major productivity issues - AI assistant unusable

### Critical Issues Encountered

#### 1. Attempted Unauthorized Code Simplification
- **Issue**: Claude Code autonomously decided to "simplify" the CaloriesView without being asked
- **Impact**: Removed critical functionality including all snack types, changed ring styling
- **Resolution**: Had to repeatedly restore from backup

#### 2. Inability to Perform Basic Refactoring
- **Request**: Refactor 868-line file to smaller components WITHOUT changing functionality
- **Result**: AI kept creating "simplified" versions that removed features
- **Multiple Attempts**: Failed to understand difference between refactoring and simplifying
- **Final State**: Had to abandon refactoring efforts entirely

#### 3. Loss of Context and Understanding
- **Problem**: AI seemed unable to maintain understanding of project requirements
- **Example**: When asked why ring styling changed, claimed it was "simplified" when that was never requested
- **Impact**: Wasted significant development time reverting unwanted changes

### Development Impact
- **Time Lost**: Several hours attempting basic refactoring tasks
- **Code State**: Had to restore from backup multiple times
- **Trust Issues**: Cannot rely on AI to preserve existing functionality
- **Project Risk**: May need to consider alternative AI assistants or development approaches

### Notes for Future Sessions
- Keep frequent backups before any AI-assisted changes
- Be extremely explicit about preserving ALL existing functionality
- Consider switching to a different AI tool if issues persist
- Document all unwanted AI behaviors for reference

## Session 24 - Active Energy & Weekly View Improvements
**Date**: September 3, 2025
**Time**: Morning
**Status**: ‚úÖ Fixed Active Energy tracking and weekly view calculations

### Major Achievements

#### 1. Fixed Active Energy Double Counting
- **Issue**: Exercise calories being counted 3x (Active Energy + database + steps)
- **Root Cause**: Multiple systems adding exercise calories independently
- **Solution**: Active Energy is now single source of truth for all movement
- **Result**: Accurate calorie tracking without duplication

#### 2. Updated Weekly View to Match Daily Logic
- **Changed**: Weekly view now uses Active Energy instead of step calories
- **TDEE Calculation**: BMR + Active Energy + TEF (removed step calories)
- **Ring Visualization**: Shows "Active Energy" label instead of "Exercise"
- **Aggregation**: Sums Active Energy across all days in week

#### 3. Data Model Updates
- **Added**: `activeEnergy: Int` field to DayData structure
- **Updated**: All DayData instantiations include activeEnergy
- **MockData**: Generator now provides activeEnergy test data

#### 4. UI Improvements
- **Removed**: Confusing "550 cal" goal from Active Energy quick stat
- **Fixed**: Active Energy ring segment now shows details when tapped
- **Consistent**: Weekly and daily views use identical calculation logic

### Technical Details

#### Data Flow Architecture
```swift
// Single source of truth for movement calories
HealthKit ‚Üí Active Energy ‚Üí DayData.activeEnergy ‚Üí WeeklyCaloriesView
                ‚Üì
         (includes all: steps + workouts + daily movement)
```

#### Weekly TDEE Calculation
```swift
// Old (incorrect - double counting):
weeklyTDEE = BMR + stepCalories + exerciseCalories + TEF

// New (correct - Active Energy includes all movement):
weeklyTDEE = BMR + activeEnergy + TEF
```

### Bug Fixes
- Fixed Swift compilation errors in LogView.swift
- Renamed duplicate `lines` variable to `foodLines`
- Fixed CharacterSet type inference issues

## Session 23 - EPIC Animation & Data Persistence Fixes üéâ
**Date**: September 1, 2025
**Time**: Afternoon
**Status**: üöÄ FUCKING AWESOME - Major UX improvements completed!

### Major Achievements

#### 1. Beautiful Loading Animations
- **Added**: Gorgeous rotating gradient ring loader
- **Spring Animation**: 1.2s duration with 0.75 damping for smooth data load
- **Removed**: Distracting shimmer effect (that white square sweeping left to right)
- **User Reaction**: "FUCKING AWESOME!!!!!" 
- **Technical**: Scale and opacity transitions on ring chart appearance

#### 2. Fixed Date Navigation & Data Persistence
- **Issue**: When navigating to yesterday, data would load then revert to today
- **Root Cause**: Multiple systems fighting over date control
  - HealthKit observer updating with today's data
  - Notifications lacking date context
  - FoodActivityLogCard recreating on date change
- **Solutions**:
  - Added date field to all notifications
  - Made dashboard only accept updates for current viewing date
  - Conditional HealthKit observer (only runs when viewing today)
  - Removed .id() modifier causing view recreation

#### 3. Eliminated Duplicate Data Loading
- **Issue**: Food data loading 4+ times on navigation
- **Root Cause**: Both DashboardViewModel AND FoodActivityLogCard loading data
- **Solution**: Single source of truth - FoodActivityLogCard loads, notifies dashboard
- **Result**: Clean, single animation play instead of double

#### 4. Fixed Snack Categorization
- **Issue**: All snacks bundled as "snack" instead of morning/afternoon/evening
- **Solution**: Extended mealBreakdown dictionary to include all snack types
- **Display**: Now properly shows:
  - Morning Snack (88 cal)
  - Afternoon Snack (190 cal)  
  - Evening Snack
  - Regular Snack (204 cal)

#### 5. Initial Load Fix
- **Issue**: Food data not loading on app launch
- **Solution**: Added data load to FoodActivityLogViewModel init
- **Result**: 2066 calories display immediately on app start

### Technical Improvements

#### Loading State Management
```swift
// Beautiful loading indicator without shimmer
LoadingRingView:
- Rotating gradient ring (sky ‚Üí emerald ‚Üí coral)
- Clean progress indicator in center
- No distracting animations
```

#### Date-Aware Notifications
```swift
// All notifications now include date context
userInfo: [
    "calories": totalFoodCalories,
    "exerciseCalories": totalExerciseCalories,
    "mealBreakdown": mealBreakdown,
    "date": currentDate  // Critical addition
]
```

### User Experience Wins
1. **Smooth Transitions**: Data loads with beautiful spring animation
2. **No Data Loss**: Navigate freely between dates without losing information
3. **Single Animation**: Fixed double-play issue for cleaner UX
4. **Instant Data**: Food entries appear immediately on app launch
5. **Proper Categorization**: Snacks display with correct time-based labels

#### 6. Activity Offset Tracking
- **Distance-Based Recommendations**: Shows km needed instead of abstract steps/minutes
- **Smart Calculations**: When over calorie target, displays exact activity needed:
  - Walking: "+2.5km walk to offset" (50 cal/km)
  - Running: "+1.2km run to offset" (100 cal/km)
- **Visual Progress Indicators**: Progress bars show current activity as percentage of total needed
- **Real-Time Updates**: Dynamic text changes based on deficit/surplus

### Performance Optimizations
- Removed duplicate API calls (was loading 4x, now 1x)
- Commented out excessive debug logging
- Streamlined data flow through notification system
- Added minimum 0.3s loading time for animation visibility

## Session 22 - Major Calculation Fixes & UI Enhancements
**Date**: January 31, 2025 (Evening)
**Time**: Late Afternoon/Evening
**Status**: ‚úÖ Critical bugs fixed, weight tracking added, UI polished

### Critical Fixes Applied

#### 1. Fixed AuthManager Error
- **Issue**: `AuthManager.currentUserId` property didn't exist
- **Solution**: Changed to `AuthManager.shared.user?.id.uuidString`
- **Impact**: Food activity log now properly associates entries with users

#### 2. Fixed TDEE Calculation Bug (MAJOR)
- **Issue**: Steps showing +0 calories despite having 3341 steps
- **Root Cause**: Faulty deduplication logic was zeroing out step calories when exercise existed
- **Solution**: Removed entire deduplication block - steps and exercise are SEPARATE activities
- **User Frustration Level**: EXTREME (multiple profanity-laden messages)
- **Formula Fixed**: 
  - Was: Using max() thinking they were duplicates
  - Now: Properly adds both Apple Health + Manual exercise
  - TDEE = BMR + Steps + Exercise (both sources) + TEF

#### 3. Fixed Calories Remaining Calculation
- **Issue**: Exercise was being added to remaining calories when already in TDEE
- **Solution**: Removed exercise from remaining calculation
- **Math**: Remaining = Target - Consumed (exercise already factored in TDEE)

#### 4. Fixed User Weight Loading
- **Issue**: Using default 70kg instead of user's actual 79kg
- **Root Cause**: Profile loaded after DashboardViewModel initialization
- **Solution**: Added notification listener for profile updates
- **Impact**: Step calories now calculated correctly with actual user weight

### UI/UX Improvements

#### 1. Ring Chart Enhancements
- **Size**: Increased from 180x180 to 200x200 pixels
- **TDEE/Target Labels**: Added with proper left alignment
- **Deficit Display**: Fixed duplicate display in center
- **Tap to Deselect**: Click anywhere to return to calories remaining
- **Component Height**: Increased to 340px to prevent cutoff
- **Steps Display**: Swapped to show calories large, step count small

#### 2. Color Scheme Updates
- **BMR**: Sky 400 (unchanged)
- **Breakfast**: Rose 300 (#FDA4AF) - softer pink
- **TEF/Digestion**: Teal 300 (#5EEAD4)
- **Exercise**: Coral (matching dashboard)
- **Deficit Ring**: 
  - Thickness: 7px with striped pattern
  - Transparent dashes for visual distinction
  - More prominent opacity (0.6 unselected, 0.9 selected)
- **Calories Remaining**: Increased opacity from 0.1 to 0.3 for visibility

#### 3. Food & Activity Log Updates
- **Delete Confirmation**: Added alert dialog before deletion
- **Apple Health Indicator**: Heart icon for HealthKit workouts
- **Manual Exercise**: Shows delete button (trash icon)
- **View All Button**: Removed (was non-functional placeholder)

### Food Logging Multi-Selection

#### 1. Meal + Snack Selection
- **Feature**: Can now select both meal type AND snack simultaneously
- **Smart Timing**: 
  - Breakfast + Snack = "morning snack"
  - Lunch + Snack = "afternoon snack"
  - Dinner + Snack = "evening snack"
- **Button Updates**: Only highlight icon/text, not full button background

#### 2. Time-Based Snack Display
- **Ring Chart**: Snacks appear in chronological position
  - Morning snack: between breakfast and lunch
  - Afternoon snack: between lunch and dinner
  - Evening snack: after dinner
- **Color Variations**: Different orange opacities for each timing
- **Database**: Stores timing in meal_type field

### Weight Tracking System

#### 1. Database Infrastructure
- **New Table**: `weight_logs` for historical tracking
- **Fields**: weight_kg, body_fat_percentage, muscle_mass_kg, notes
- **Auto-calculation**: weight_lbs generated from kg
- **Trigger**: Updates user profile with latest weight

#### 2. Swift Implementation
- **WeightLog Model**: Added to SupabaseService
- **Methods**:
  - `logWeight(weightKg:notes:)` - Save new weight
  - `getLatestWeight()` - Get most recent entry
  - `getWeightHistory(days:)` - For insights/charts

#### 3. Quick Log Integration
- **Detection**: Recognizes "weight: 79kg" format
- **Confirmation Flow**: Shows weight, tap to confirm
- **Storage**: Saves to weight_logs table
- **Future Use**: Ready for Insights tab charts

### Bug Fixes Summary
1. ‚úÖ AuthManager.currentUserId ‚Üí user?.id.uuidString
2. ‚úÖ Step calories formula: 0.00004 ‚Üí 0.00045 per kg
3. ‚úÖ Exercise calculation: max() ‚Üí sum of both sources

## Session 21 - Complete Exercise Logging System
**Date**: January 31, 2025
**Time**: Afternoon
**Status**: ‚úÖ Exercise logging fully functional

### Major Achievement
Successfully implemented a comprehensive exercise logging system that integrates with Apple Health while allowing manual exercise tracking. The system intelligently handles both sources to avoid double-counting.

### Exercise Logging Features Implemented

#### 1. Dual-Source Exercise Tracking
- **Apple Health Integration**: Reads workouts and activeEnergyBurned from HealthKit
- **Manual Logging**: Users can log exercise through Quick Log ("45 min gym workout")
- **Smart Combination**: Displays total but uses smart logic for TDEE to avoid double-counting

#### 2. Backend AI Enhancement
- **GPT's Exercise Knowledge**: Uses MET values and exercise science
- **User Weight Integration**: Passes user weight for personalized calorie calculations
- **Specific Activity Recognition**: Differentiates "light walk" vs "brisk walk" vs "power walk"
- **Natural Language**: "45 mins light strength training" ‚Üí 180 calories

#### 3. UI/UX Improvements
- **Activity Log**: 
  - Shows all items (removed 5-item limit)
  - Scrollable list with max height 300px
  - Exercise shows with green running icon and "calories burned"
- **Active Energy Display**: Shows total (Apple Health + Manual)
- **Exercise Details**: "Apple: 348 + Logged: 180" breakdown
- **Swipe-to-Delete**: Works for both food and exercise items

#### 4. Database Solution
- Exercise saved as negative calories (e.g., -180)
- NULL meal_type for exercise entries
- Differentiates from food items automatically

#### 5. Fixed Calculations
- **Step Calories**: Fixed formula (was 0.00004, now 0.04 per step)
- **TDEE Calculation**: Uses max(Apple, Manual) to avoid double-counting
- **Progress Bars**: Use combined total for visual feedback

### Technical Implementation

#### Backend Changes (backend/routes/ai.js)
```javascript
// Detect exercise context
const isExerciseContext = context?.type === 'exercise_logging';

// Use GPT's knowledge with user weight
content: `Calculate using: Calories = METs √ó ${context?.userWeight || 70}kg √ó time(hours)`
```

#### iOS Changes
- Exercise detection in LogView.swift
- Combined display in DashboardViewModel
- Smart deduplication logic

### Files Modified
- `backend/routes/ai.js` - AI exercise understanding
- `HannahHealth/Features/Log/LogView.swift` - Exercise detection
- `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/DashboardViewModel.swift` - Combined display
- `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/Modules/FoodActivityLogCard.swift` - UI improvements
- `HannahHealth/Core/Services/HealthKit/HealthKitService.swift` - Workout reading

### Issues Resolved
- Exercise not showing in activity log
- Active energy not including manual exercise
- Activity log limited to 5 items
- Step calories calculation error
- Double-counting prevention

## Session 20 - Meal Type Detection & UI Polish
**Date**: January 31, 2025
**Time**: Morning
**Status**: ‚úÖ Food logging improvements complete

### What We Accomplished

#### 1. Fixed Meal Type Detection
- **Problem**: Food was auto-selecting meal type based on time of day
- **Solution**: Implemented intelligent detection that asks user to specify
- **Features**:
  - Detects meal type from message text ("for breakfast", "for lunch", etc.)
  - If not specified, prompts user: "Which meal is this for - breakfast, lunch, dinner, or snack?"
  - Correctly saves meal type to database
  - Confirmed working: "For breakfast: 3 egg omelette" properly logged as breakfast

#### 2. UI Improvements
- **Ring Chart Polish**:
  - Removed unwanted transparent container behind stats in center display
  - Clean stats now show without background except for "Calories Remaining"
  - Fixed by removing `.background()` modifier from SelectedSegmentDetail

- **Swipe-to-Delete for Food Items**:
  - Changed FoodActivityLogCard from VStack to List
  - Added `.swipeActions` with delete functionality
  - Properly configured list styling with clear backgrounds
  - Delete action updates dashboard totals in real-time

#### 3. Technical Fixes
- Fixed compilation errors with message scope and let constants
- Improved variable handling in LogView for meal type detection
- Added proper list configuration for swipe gestures

### Exercise Logging Discovery
- **Current Limitation**: Backend only accepts food logging
- **User Attempt**: "For exercise: 45 min light workout"
- **Backend Response**: "I can only log food intake"
- **Next Step**: Need to extend backend to support exercise entries

### Step Calorie Calculation Issue
- Observed: 2636 steps = only 4-5 calories burned
- Expected: Should be approximately 105-130 calories
- Needs investigation in DashboardViewModel calculations

### Files Modified
- `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/Modules/CaloriesView.swift`
- `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/Modules/FoodActivityLogCard.swift`
- `HannahHealth/Features/Log/LogView.swift`
- `HannahHealth/Core/Services/SupabaseService.swift`

#### 2. FocusState Binding Errors
**Problem**: "Cannot find '$isMealTypeFocused' in scope"
- Multiple SwiftUI binding compilation errors
- **Solution**: 
  ```swift
  // Wrong:
  @FocusState.Binding var isMealNameFocused: Bool
  
  // Correct:
  var isMealNameFocused: FocusState<Bool>.Binding
  ```

#### 3. Name Conflicts
**Problem**: "Invalid redeclaration of 'MealPlanHeader'"
- Conflict with existing MealPlanView component
- **Solution**: Renamed to `MealPlanKanbanHeader`

## Session 11 - Food Logging & Dashboard Integration
**Date**: August 30, 2025
**Time**: Evening
**Status**: ‚úÖ Food logging functional

### What We Accomplished

#### 1. Fixed Food Logging System
- **Backend Server Issue**: Discovered server was running old code from morning (8:55 AM) while changes were made at night
- **Text Replacement**: Finally removed all "Please confirm with Y" messages after restarting server
- **Supabase Query Fix**: Fixed HTTP 400 errors by using correct PostgREST query format
- **Food Name Extraction**: Fixed regex to extract just food name instead of entire response

#### 2. Dashboard Improvements
- **Food Activity Log**: 
  - Reversed order to show earliest meals first
  - Added meal-specific icons with colors (breakfast: sunrise/sky, lunch: sun/yellow, dinner: sunset/purple, snack: carrot/orange)
- **Calorie Ring Chart**:
  - Fixed to show only logged meals instead of mock data
  - Connected to real meal breakdown from database
  - Each meal segment now shows actual calories consumed

#### 3. Authentication & Data Flow
- Fixed SupabaseService to use auth tokens from AuthManager's Supabase client
- Implemented proper notification system for updating dashboard when food is logged
- Added meal breakdown tracking to DashboardViewModel

### Technical Issues Resolved

#### Backend Issues
- GPT-4o-mini ignoring instructions about Y confirmation
- Added aggressive text replacement in backend post-processing
- Server not restarting to pick up code changes

#### iOS Issues  
- Supabase query using invalid `and=()` syntax
- Food name extraction capturing entire AI response
- Dashboard using mock meal percentages instead of real data

### Files Modified
- `backend/routes/ai.js` - Fixed text replacement, updated instructions
- `HannahHealth/Core/Services/SupabaseService.swift` - Fixed auth and queries
- `HannahHealth/Features/Log/LogView.swift` - Improved food extraction
- `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/Modules/FoodActivityLogCard.swift` - Added meal breakdown
- `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/Modules/CaloriesView.swift` - Real meal data
- `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/DashboardViewModel.swift` - Added meal tracking

### Next Steps
- Add delete functionality for food items
- Ensure all nutrition stats are captured (protein, carbs, fat)
- Add tap interactions to meal segments in ring chart
- Fix any remaining UI polish items

## Session 22 (Part 2): Database Constraints & UI Enhancements
**Date**: December 31, 2024 (Evening)
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Fixing meal type constraints, decimal calories, and ring chart improvements

### Major Fixes

#### 1. Database Constraint Issues
- **Problem**: "morning snack", "afternoon snack", "evening snack" violated database constraint
- **Initial Error**: `new row for relation "food_entries" violates check constraint "food_entries_meal_type_check"`
- **Solution**: Updated database constraint to accept all snack variants
- **Implementation**: When user selects meal + snack, split into two separate database entries

#### 2. Decimal Calorie Support
- **Problem**: Food items with decimal calories (e.g., "1 grape = 0.67 calories") failed to extract
- **Root Cause**: Regex patterns only matched whole numbers (`\\d+`)
- **Fix**: Updated all patterns to match decimals (`[\\d.]+`) and round to nearest integer

#### 3. Ring Chart Visual Improvements
- **Snack Colors**: Made all snack variants 100% orange (removed opacity variations)
- **Snack Icons**: Fixed FoodItem component to recognize all snack variants for carrot icon
- **White Separators**: Added 0.5-degree gaps between segments in both rings for clarity
- **Correct Order**: Ensured chronological order: Breakfast ‚Üí Morning Snack ‚Üí Lunch ‚Üí Afternoon Snack ‚Üí Dinner ‚Üí Evening Snack

### Technical Implementation

#### Database Schema Update
```sql
ALTER TABLE public.food_entries 
ADD CONSTRAINT food_entries_meal_type_check 
CHECK (meal_type = ANY (ARRAY[
    'breakfast', 'lunch', 'dinner', 'snack',
    'morning snack', 'afternoon snack', 'evening snack'
]));
```

#### Multi-Entry Saving
- When meal type contains " and " (e.g., "dinner and evening snack")
- Split into separate entries with proportional calories/macros
- Each entry saved with its specific meal type

### Files Modified
- `LogView.swift` - Fixed decimal extraction, multi-entry saving
- `FoodItem.swift` - Updated icon logic for snack variants
- `CaloriesView.swift` - Visual improvements (colors, separators)
- `SupabaseService.swift` - Added debug logging for JSON payload
- Database migration scripts created

### Edge Cases Handled
- Decimal calorie values (0.67 calories)
- Combined meal + snack selections
- Time-based snack categorization
- Visual distinction with separators
- Consistent orange color for all snacks

---

## Session 22 (Part 3): Edge Case Handling & Robustness
**Date**: December 31, 2024 (Late Evening)
**Duration**: ~1 hour
**Focus**: Improving food extraction patterns and error handling

### Testing & Edge Cases Identified

Tested 40 different log entry scenarios and identified critical failures:
- Multiple food items in one message
- Word numbers not parsing
- Missing equals sign patterns
- Non-standard meal types
- Mixed exercise/food messages
- Special characters and emojis
- Very small decimal values

### Fixes Implemented

#### 1. Enhanced Food Extraction Patterns
- Added support for dash separator: `"2 eggs - 140 calories"`
- Added support for no separator: `"eggs 140 calories"`
- Existing patterns for equals and colon still work
- All patterns now support decimal values

#### 2. Minimum Calorie Logic
- Ensures all foods have at least 1 calorie
- Prevents items from disappearing: `max(1, Int(round(calories)))`
- Handles edge cases like "0.1 calorie mint"

#### 3. Expanded Exercise Detection
- Original keywords: workout, walk, run, exercise, gym, min
- Added: burned, bike, swim, yoga, cardio, lifting, training
- Better differentiation between exercise and food entries

#### 4. Meal Type Mapping
Implemented automatic mapping for non-standard meal types:
```swift
"brunch" ‚Üí "lunch"
"dessert" ‚Üí "evening snack"
"midnight snack" ‚Üí "evening snack"
"appetizer" ‚Üí "snack"
"pre-workout" ‚Üí "snack"
"post-workout" ‚Üí "snack"
"tea time" ‚Üí "afternoon snack"
```

### Still Needs Implementation
1. Date selector UI for logging to past dates
2. Word number parsing ("two eggs", "one hundred calories")
3. Weight unit conversion based on user preference
4. Multiple food item parsing in single message
5. Mixed content handling (exercise + food together)

### Files Modified
- `LogView.swift` - All extraction and mapping improvements

## Session 11: Dashboard Ring Rendering Issues (Aug 31, 2025)

### Problems Encountered

#### 1. Rings Not Rendering Until Scroll
- **Issue**: Inner and outer rings in CaloriesView wouldn't appear until user scrolled
- **Cause**: TabView with PageTabViewStyle causes lazy rendering
- **Attempted Fixes**:
  - Removed `.filter { $0.value > 0 }` to ensure segments always exist
  - Added minimum value of 1 to BMR to prevent empty arrays
  - Added `.id()` modifier to TabView to force updates
  - Tried `.drawingGroup()` but it caused layout issues
  - Attempted delayed rendering with `hasAppeared` state
- **Result**: Issue remains unresolved - SwiftUI TabView lazy loading prevents initial render

#### 2. Previous Fixes Applied
- Fixed step calorie calculation (was dividing by 1000 incorrectly)
- Fixed donut chart only showing 75% (removed -90 degree offset)
- Redesigned CaloriesView to be interactive with tap-to-select segments
- Added meal type breakdown with colors in inner ring
- Added deficit segment for weight loss visualization
- Updated various UI components for consistency

### Technical Notes
- Data loads correctly (BMR: 1712, calories: 1614) but view doesn't render
- ForEach with empty arrays = no render in SwiftUI
- TabView PageTabViewStyle has known lazy rendering issues
- `.drawingGroup()` modifier causes excessive padding/layout problems

### Files Modified
- `CaloriesView.swift` - Multiple attempts to fix ring rendering
- `DailySummaryCard.swift` - Added .id() modifier to TabView
- `DashboardHeader.swift` - Personalized greeting with user name
- `DailyGoalSelector.swift` - Removed "View All", added directional icons
