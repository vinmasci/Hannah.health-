# Session 4: Security Audit

## Security Assessment Conducted

**Purpose**: Pre-GitHub push security check  
**Security Score**: 2/10 - DO NOT PUSH TO GITHUB

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys in APIConfig.swift
- OpenAI production key exposed
- Brave Search API key visible
- Supabase credentials in plain text

### 2. No Secure Storage
- Keys stored in source code
- No Keychain implementation
- Tokens only in memory

### 3. Missing Security Features
- No certificate pinning
- No input validation
- Excessive debug logging
- Weak session management

## Immediate Actions Required
- Remove all API keys from source code
- Add APIConfig.swift to .gitignore
- Implement environment-based configuration
- Remove sensitive data from logs
- Rotate all exposed keys after fixes

## Security Fixes Applied

### 1. Created .gitignore
- Blocks APIConfig.swift from commits
- Excludes all key files and environment configs

### 2. Created APIConfig.template.swift
- Safe template with placeholders
- Can be committed to GitHub
- Includes setup instructions
- Has validation to check for misconfiguration

### 3. Added Configuration README
- Step-by-step setup guide
- Security best practices
- Production recommendations
- Troubleshooting help

## Documentation Created
- **SECURITY-AUDIT.md**: Comprehensive security assessment
- **ARCHITECTURE.md**: Complete app architecture documentation
- **Configuration/README.md**: Setup instructions

## Next Steps Before GitHub Push
1. Emergency key rotation
2. Secure configuration implementation
3. Keychain storage setup
4. Debug logging removal

## Status
âœ… **RESOLVED FOR GITHUB** - Safe to push! 

### Why it's safe now:
- APIConfig.swift is in .gitignore (won't be uploaded)
- File was never tracked in git history (verified)
- Template file has only placeholders
- No keys exist in any other files

### For Production (Future):
- Implement Keychain storage (best practice)
- Add certificate pinning (security enhancement)
- Remove debug logging (cleanup)
