# Session 23: Active Energy & Weekly View Improvements

## Date: 2025-09-03

## Summary
Fixed Active Energy tracking and updated weekly view to use the same Active Energy-based logic as the daily view, preventing double/triple counting of exercise calories.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Active Energy Field to Data Model
- **File**: `HannahHealth/Core/Models/DashboardData.swift`
- Added `activeEnergy: Int` field to `DayData` structure
- Updated `MockDataGenerator` to populate activeEnergy field

### 2. Updated DashboardViewModel 
- **File**: `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/DashboardViewModel.swift`
- Modified all three `DayData` instantiations to include activeEnergy
- Added code to fetch and store Active Energy when loading historical data
- Updated `fetchWeekData` to populate activeEnergy from HealthKit

### 3. Fixed Weekly Calories View
- **File**: `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/Modules/WeeklyCaloriesView.swift`
- Changed `weeklyExerciseCalories` to sum Active Energy from all days instead of using workout minutes
- Set `computedWeeklyStepCalories` to 0 to avoid double counting
- Updated TDEE calculation: `computedWeeklyTDEE = computedWeeklyBMR + weeklyExerciseCalories + weeklyTEF`
- Removed step calories from TDEE calculation as Active Energy already includes all movement

### 4. Updated Ring Visualization Components
- **File**: `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/Modules/DonutChartComponents.swift`
- Renamed "Exercise" segment to "Active Energy" in TDEEDonutRing
- Updated SelectedSegmentDetail to handle "Active Energy" segment name
- Changed display text from "Active calories" to "All movement"
- Added case handling for both "Exercise" and "Active Energy" for backward compatibility

### 5. Removed Goal from Active Energy Quick Stat
- **File**: `HannahHealth/Features/Dashboard/Modules/QuickStatsGrid.swift`
- Changed Active Energy stat card to pass empty string for target
- Removes the "550 cal" goal display from Active Energy quick stat

### 6. Fixed Swift Compilation Errors
- **File**: `HannahHealth/Features/Log/LogView.swift`
- Fixed line 845: Changed `.whitespacesAndNewlines` to `CharacterSet.whitespacesAndNewlines`
- Fixed line 843: Renamed duplicate `lines` variable to `foodLines`

## Key Improvements

### Accurate Calorie Tracking
- Weekly view now correctly uses Active Energy from HealthKit
- Prevents double/triple counting when:
  - User tracks outdoor runs with iPhone (Active Energy)
  - Has database exercise entries
  - Has step-based calorie calculations
- Active Energy is now the single source of truth for all movement/exercise calories

### Consistent Weekly/Daily Views
- Weekly ring visualization matches daily ring logic
- Both views now:
  - Use Active Energy as primary exercise metric
  - Don't calculate step calories separately 
  - Show "Active Energy" label in ring segments
  - Display steps for information only (not for calorie calculations)

### User Experience
- Active Energy quick stat no longer shows confusing goal
- Ring segments properly respond to taps showing Active Energy details
- Weekly aggregations correctly sum Active Energy across all days

## Technical Details

### Data Flow
1. HealthKit provides Active Energy (includes all movement)
2. DayData stores activeEnergy separately from steps
3. WeeklyCaloriesView aggregates activeEnergy across days
4. TDEE calculation uses: BMR + Active Energy + TEF (no step calories)

### Migration Considerations
- Backward compatible with existing data
- Handles both "Exercise" and "Active Energy" segment names
- MockDataGenerator updated to provide test data

## Testing Notes
- Verify weekly ring shows correct Active Energy totals
- Check that tapping Active Energy segment shows details
- Confirm no double counting in weekly totals
- Test with various combinations of HealthKit data

## Next Steps
- Consider adding Active Energy trend charts
- Implement weekly Active Energy goals
- Add comparison views (week over week)
