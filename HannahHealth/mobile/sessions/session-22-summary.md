# Session 22: Critical TDEE Fixes & Weight Tracking

**Date**: December 31, 2024
**Duration**: ~2 hours
**Focus**: Bug fixes, UI enhancements, weight tracking infrastructure

## Critical Fixes

### 1. TDEE Calculation Bugs (HIGH PRIORITY)
- **Problem**: Steps showing +0 calories despite having 3341 steps
- **Root Cause**: Faulty deduplication logic was zeroing out step calories when exercise was present
- **Fix**: Removed entire deduplication block - steps and exercise are SEPARATE components
- **Result**: TDEE now correctly calculates as BMR + Steps + Exercise + TEF

### 2. Exercise Calculation Error
- **Problem**: Using `max()` instead of `sum` for Apple Health + Manual exercise
- **Fix**: Changed to add both sources: `appleHealthCalories + manualCalories`
- **Impact**: Exercise calories now correctly show total from all sources

### 3. AuthManager Reference Error
- **Problem**: `AuthManager.currentUserId` property doesn't exist
- **Fix**: Updated to use `AuthManager.shared.user?.id.uuidString`
- **Files**: FoodActivityLogCard.swift

## UI Enhancements

### CaloriesView Component
- Added TDEE and Target labels with left alignment
- Increased component height: 280 → 340 points
- Fixed component cutoff issues
- Removed duplicate deficit display in center
- Updated ring chart colors:
  - Breakfast: Rose 300
  - TEF: Teal 300
  - Deficit: Thinner ring (7px) with striped pattern
- Added proper padding for titles
- Fixed default selection to return to "Calories Remaining"

### Activity Log
- Added delete confirmation alerts
- Fixed delete button icon (was showing heart, now shows trash)
- Improved Apple Health workout identification

## New Features

### Multi-Selection Food Logging
- Implemented meal + snack simultaneous selection
- Time-based snack categorization:
  - Breakfast → Morning Snack
  - Lunch → Afternoon Snack
  - Dinner → Evening Snack
- Updated button highlighting to only show icon/text color
- Color-matched buttons to dashboard components

### Weight Tracking Infrastructure
- Created complete database schema (`weight_tracking_schema.sql`)
- Added WeightLog model to SupabaseService
- Implemented weight logging methods:
  - `logWeight()`
  - `getLatestWeight()`
  - `getWeightHistory()`
- Added profile update notifications for weight changes
- Database trigger to update user profile with latest weight

## Technical Details

### Files Modified
1. `DashboardViewModel.swift` - Fixed TDEE calculations, added profile listeners
2. `CaloriesView.swift` - UI enhancements, label additions
3. `FoodActivityLogCard.swift` - AuthManager fix, delete confirmations
4. `LogView.swift` - Multi-selection implementation
5. `SupabaseService.swift` - Weight tracking methods

### Files Created
1. `weight_tracking_schema.sql` - Complete weight tracking database schema
2. `session-22-summary.md` - This summary

## User Experience Impact
- Accurate calorie tracking finally working correctly
- More intuitive food logging with meal + snack selection
- Better visual hierarchy with proper labels and spacing
- Foundation laid for weight trend tracking in Insights tab

## Next Steps
1. Run weight_tracking_schema.sql in Supabase
2. Test weight logging end-to-end
3. Implement Insights tab with weight charts
4. Add weekly weight change notifications

## Lessons Learned
- Always verify mathematical calculations with real data
- Deduplication logic needs careful consideration of data sources
- User frustration peaks when simple math appears broken
- Component sizing needs testing with all possible states
