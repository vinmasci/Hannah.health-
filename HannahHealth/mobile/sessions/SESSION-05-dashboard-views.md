# Session 5: Multi-Temporal Dashboard System

## Goal
Transform dashboard from single daily view to multi-temporal analytics system with Day, Week, and Month views.

## Features Implemented

### Navigation System
- **View Period Selector**: `<` `Day` `Week` `Month` `>` controls
- Pill-style buttons matching meal plan design
- Solid emerald highlighting for selected period
- Context-aware navigation (arrows move by day/week/month)

### Three Dashboard Views

#### 1. Day View
- Original dashboard layout preserved
- Daily calories, macros, steps, water
- Food & activity log
- Hannah's advice

#### 2. Week View
- Week summary card with totals and averages
- Weekly calorie totals (e.g., 12,950 calories)
- Daily averages (e.g., 1,850 cal/day)
- Weight change tracking if available
- Placeholder for charts (line graph, bar charts)

#### 3. Month View
- Monthly summary with total days tracked
- Average daily calories for the month
- Month name display (Jan, Feb, etc.)
- Placeholder for calendar heatmap

## Mock Data System
- **MockDataGenerator** creates 90 days of historical data
- Realistic patterns (weekends vs weekdays)
- Gradual weight loss trend
- Variable meal patterns with actual food names
- Automatic data grouping by weeks and months

## Technical Implementation
- **ViewPeriod enum**: Manages day/week/month states
- **DashboardData models**: DayData, WeekData, MonthData structures
- **ViewPeriodSelector component**: Reusable navigation control
- **DashboardViewModel updates**: Navigation state and data management
- **Reactive UI**: Automatic updates when period or date changes

## Visual Design
- Maintained glass morphism throughout
- Dynamic time-based backgrounds preserved
- Consistent Theme colors (emerald, sky, amber, etc.)
- Smooth transitions between views
- Clear period display text (e.g., "Monday, Jan 27" or "Jan 21 - Jan 27")

## User Experience
- Instant view switching
- Clear temporal context
- Intuitive navigation with arrows
- Consistent with app's design language

## Files Created/Modified
- `DashboardData.swift` - Data models for all periods
- `ViewPeriodSelector.swift` - Navigation component
- `MockDataGenerator.swift` - 90 days of sample data
- `DashboardViewModel.swift` - Added navigation state
- `DashboardView.swift` - Complete UI transformation
- `DASHBOARD-VIEWS.md` - Comprehensive planning document
