# Session 3: Meal Planning & Shopping List

## Meal Plan Feature

### Implementation
Created full meal planning system with Week 1 Magic concept - unlocks after 7 days of consistent food tracking.

### UI Design
- Applied chat-style clean UI with glass morphism
- Dynamic time-based backgrounds matching dashboard
- Color-coded meal types:
  - Breakfast: Sky 400 (#38BDF8)
  - Lunch: Amber 400 (#F59E0B)
  - Dinner: Indigo 400 (#6366F1)
  - Snack: Emerald 400 (#10B981)
- Day selector tabs with solid emerald for selected day
- Weekly goals summary card

### Chat Integration
- Detects meal plan requests in natural language
- Generates personalized plans via ChatGPT
- Navigates to meal plan tab after generation

## Shopping List Feature

### Implementation
Auto-generates from meal plan ingredients with smart consolidation.

### Features
- Smart consolidation of duplicate items
- Category organization (Produce, Proteins, Dairy, etc.)
- Progress ring showing completion percentage
- Category filter pills for quick filtering
- Check-off system with animations
- Add custom items capability

### Visual Consistency
- Same DynamicTimeBackground() as rest of app
- Theme.glassMorphism for all cards
- White text with opacity hierarchy
- Consistent color scheme across categories

## Key Design Decisions
- Used transparent black (50% opacity) instead of white backgrounds
- Kept dynamic backgrounds that change with time of day
- Made selected states solid colors for clarity
- Applied consistent glass morphism throughout
